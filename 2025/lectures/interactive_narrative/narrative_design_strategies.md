# Interactive Narrative: Conceptual Approaches

*Adapted/cribbed from lecture notes by Paolo Pedercini. This is his work!* 

#### Overview

Here are some ways of thinking about approaching the creation of an interactive narrative.

* Adaptation
* Non-Fiction
* Nonlinear Space-Time
* Protagonist-First
* Structure-First
* Location-First

## Adaptation

Start from an existing story or artifact and add your twist. For example, *Hamlet*, BUT you are Elsinore and you can change the course of the story. ([*Elsinore*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6rMdih6ljA) by Golden Glitch. Watch 3:00-4:00)

*Little Red Riding Hood for Young adults* – the coming to age themes are foregrounded and the style is gothic. ([*The Path*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zusJYzOOHco) by Tale of Tales. Watch 1:00-1:30)

An [adaptation](https://radiatoryang.itch.io/hardlads) of the viral video “[British lads hit each other with a chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9oZaP-my5E)” in which you are the cameraman and it’s gay magical realism. ([*Hard Lads*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_TAeq9pJNY) by Robert Yang)

## Non-Fiction

What if it’s based on a historical, biographical scenario?

A puzzle platformer but each “level” is a scene narrating the overthrowing of the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran by the CIA and the UK. ([*The Cat and the Coup*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4dXTJTgeY) by Peter Brinson and Kurosh ValaNejad. Watch 0:05-0:35)

[![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wy4dXTJTgeY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4dXTJTgeY)

A guided tour of assets ripped from Assassin's Creed but actually a videogame essay examining digital cathedral builders and their medieval counterparts in relation to the unionization of game developers. ([*Gameworkers and Guildworkers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo8KUBRUUck) by Cat Bluemke / SpekWork. Watch 7:20-7:50)

A dating sim based on actual stories and techniques used by pick-up artists (and you are the one being picked up). ([*The Game: The Game*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUVmu1El77w) by Angela Washko)

## Nonlinear Space-Time

What if the rooms jumped between different times and spaces? ([*Thirty Flights of Loving*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0dCRb8PEeY) by Blendo Games)

[![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/d0dCRb8PEeY/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0dCRb8PEeY)

[*That Night, Steeped by Blood River*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qzbMPpgtDw) by Taylor Sweitanski:

## Protagonist-First

What if the character is not a blank slate? What is the character’s motivation?

You are a quack doctor trying to get a medical license in Shakespearean times. ([*Astrologaster*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZUEy7Qphg) by Nyamyam)

[![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/KCZUEy7Qphg/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCZUEy7Qphg)

You are trying to come out to your conservative family. ([*Coming Out Simulator*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CLNBl0yZDA) by Nicky Case)

[![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4CLNBl0yZDA/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CLNBl0yZDA)

You are a mom, hanging around aimless while your teenage daughter is throwing an art party. ([*Little Party*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC8u2nSnqYI) by Turnfollow)

## Structure-First

Puzzles, quest, investigation, time loops… Bitsy may be limited in the interactivity it affords, but we can imagine mechanics that are not there.

You are with your lover in the 10 seconds before the world ends; what do you do? ([*Queers in Love at the End of the World*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Uzs-yMn7s) by Anna Anthropy)

[![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/d6Uzs-yMn7s/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Uzs-yMn7s)

You are browsing an archive try to piece together parts of a conspiracy that actually happened. ([*A Hand With Many Fingers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8hoe20F-2Y) by Colestia)

[![Video Thumbnail](https://img.youtube.com/vi/b8hoe20F-2Y/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8hoe20F-2Y)

A typical branching structure, but the choices are about navigating the complex political factions of the 1979 revolution in Iran. ([*1979 Revolution: Black Friday*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwRPZv6EFTg) by N-Fusion Interactive / iNK Stories)

## Strategy: Location-First

A common approach: the protagonist is the place, and the story is told through objects and spaces.

There are plenty of mansions and islands in arty exploration games. What could be some other unique, self-contained spaces?
