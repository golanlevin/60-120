# Overview of the Bitsy Game Editor

![bitsy_mystery_dungeon.png](img/bitsy_mystery_dungeon.png)

* [**Bitsy**](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) is a little editor for little games or worlds. 
* Bitsy games typically involve some kind of avatar moving through different rooms.
* Each room is made from repeatable tiles and can contain interactive objects and exits to other rooms.
* “Pushing against” interactive objects can make them disappear (collectables) or display text (dialogues, monologues, descriptions, narration).
* Bitsy's features are highly constrained (colors, resolution, animation. 
* There are lots of hacks and mods for extending Bitsy. Bitsy doesn’t require programming, though you can add it if you want.

### Adam's Introduction

Bitsy has been ~mostly made by one person, Adam LeDoux, with many contributions from a much wider community. Here are some slides from a talk Adam gave at CMU a few years ago:

As Adam points out, Bitsy includes a map editor, sprite editor, palette tool, dialog tool, and easy export for the web. Adam also points out that programming is not required.

* Adam points out that people make all sorts of things with Bitsy, including interactive games, animations, and stories. Bitsy is ideal for making *personal games*. 
* Adam was inspired to make Bitsy by toys like [Polly Pocket](img/polly-pocket.jpg), and other microworlds like dioramas, sketchbooks, Lego, and more. 
* Adam was also inspired by older creativity software like [KidPix](https://kidpix.app/), and newer software like [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). 
* Bitsy is also a community with *values* (welcoming, inclusive, anti-bigotry, anti-capitalist, collaborative, supportive).
