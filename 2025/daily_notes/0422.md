### Special Event: *Tender Roots* (4/25)

This **Friday, April 25th**, 6-8pm, there will be a special event at WQED (4802 5th Ave, Studio A, at the edge of campus): **Tender Roots** is an evening of sound, inflatables, and animation. Sonic compositions, giant inflatable sculptures, and animation come together to create an immersive landscape. Audience members can explore the dynamic creations made by students of *Experimental Sound Synthesis* (taught by Annie Hui-Hsin Hsieh), *Inflatables* (taught by Olivia Robinson), and School of Art *Senior Studio* (advised by Johannes DeYoung).
