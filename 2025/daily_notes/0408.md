From this [**lecture on Typologies**](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/docs/typologies.md#collections-presented-in-time):

> 'One' example is not sufficiently evidential ('one' might be a coincidence), but 'many', repeatedly, are compelling ‚Äì they become proof."

* [William Henry Fox Talbot's *The Library* (1845) and Louis Daguerre's *Shells and Fossils*](https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/master/docs/typologies.md#photographic-typologies) 

A **small multiple** is a series of similar graphs or charts using the same scale and axes, which allow them to be easily compared. The term was popularized by information designer Edward Tufte, who wrote:

> At the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question: Compared to what? Small multiple designs, multivariate and data bountiful, answer directly by visually enforcing comparisons of changes, of the differences among objects, of the scope of alternatives. For a wide range of problems in data presentation, small multiples are the best design solution.
