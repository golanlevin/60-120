# Assignments 4.x: Digital Curation

---

Digital Curation / Internet Readymade

For this one-week project, you are asked to indulge in your inclination to surf the web, to go down a rabbit hole, to immerse yourself in internet platforms, to distill a collection of objects that seem extraordinary only to you, and to rescue these data from obscurity. To understand what I mean, see our lecture notes.

For this project, I am not particularly interested in your ability to imagine and create; I am interested in your capacity to discover, document, and collect. Now:

* **Research** a type of artifact, media, subculture or practice you find on the internet.
* **Create** a collection of pertinent digital “media-objects” that you consider valuable but under-appreciated from an aesthetic, political, historical, or anthropological standpoint.
* **Curate** these objects into an exhibition. Make a discovery, curate a collection, allow the things you find to speak for themselves. **Present** this collection in an online collage using either [**Hotglue.me**](https://hotglue.me/) or [**mmm.page**](https://mmm.page/). You’ll need to make a free Hotglue account.
* In a Discord post in the `#4-digital-curation` channel, **provide** a link to your Hotglue collage.
* In your post, **write** a few sentences about what your collection is, why it interests you, and any special remarks about how you collected it.
* In your post, **include** a screenshot of your Hotglue page.
