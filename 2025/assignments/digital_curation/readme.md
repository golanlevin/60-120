### Digital Curation / Internet Readymade

This brief assignment challenges you to *discover*, *document*, *collect*, *curate*, and *publish*. By contrast: we will not be focusing on ability to *imagine* or *create*. 

Your task is to compile a collection of things that seem extraordinary only to you, and to rescue them from obscurity by presenting them in a "single-serving" web page. (Note that you are *not* creating a website for yourself or your own art — though you will learn some tools for doing so.)


For this **Thursday April 10th**:

* **Create** a coherent *collection* of digital “media-objects” that you consider valuable but under-appreciated from an aesthetic, political, historical, or anthropological standpoint. Ideally, your collection should reveal your distinctive taste as an observer and collector. Your collection could be a type of artifact, media, subculture or practice you find on the internet, or it could be something from real life that you have noticed and collected.
* **Curate** these objects into an exhibition. Make a discovery, curate a collection, allow the things you find to speak for themselves. **Present** this collection in an online page using either [**Hotglue.me**](https://hotglue.me/) or [**mmm.page**](https://mmm.page/). Note that you will need to make a free account.
* In a Discord post in the `#4-digital-curation` channel, **provide** a URL link to your Hotglue/mmm page.
* In your post, **write** a few sentences about *what* your collection is, *why* it interests you, and any special remarks about *how* you collected it.
* In your post, **include** some small images of examples of the things you collected. 
* In your post, **include** a screenshot of your Hotglue/mmm page.

### Guidance 

* The more *arcane and impossibly specific* your collection is, the better. I challenge you to identify and collect a category of something that has never been identified before.
* Consider how you can present your items in juxtaposition, to heighten their differences and contrasts.
* Any collection is acceptable, including the collection project that you made for your "Risk, Agency, Failure" course, *with one exception*: you may **not** document trash from the food you ate. I have seen this concept too many times.
