## 2.2. Looking Outwards: Procedural Generative Art


(***1 hour, due Thursday 1/30***). *First*, spend **10 minutes** familiarizing hyourself with the following: 

* [Reference](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/)
* YouTube channels ([Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA), [XinXin](https://www.youtube.com/@xinxin1011), [PattVira](https://www.youtube.com/@pattvira)), 
* [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/discover/#/trending) community site
* [FxHash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) marketplace

Now (50 minutes) -- In this exercise, you will look at generative artwork by a handful of specific artists who write code to create visual images, animations, and interactions. In general, their work does not use artificial intelligence or machine learning. Instead, they write code which uses randomness to generate a variety of related results.

For each of the following artists, spend a solid 5 minutes browsing each of their online portfolios. Identify a project that you like. Post a message to the Discord channel `#2-2-looking-outwards`, with an image of the project and a sentence or two about why it caught your eye.
