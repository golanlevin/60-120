## 2.2. Ecosystem Familiarization 

### *(15 minutes; Due ASAP, but no later than 02/04.)*

**Spend 15 minutes familiarizing yourself** with the following online resources. The goal here is simply to make sure you are *aware* of these media, that you know *where* to find them, and that you know *how* they can help you. *There is no deliverable for this exercise.*

* Here's a [p5.js **Cheat Sheet**](https://bmoren.github.io/p5js-cheat-sheet/)
* This is the official [p5.js **Reference**](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/) (and its [newer version](https://p5js.org/reference/))
* Here are the [p5.js **Examples**](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/). I recommend you browse at least 5 of them.
* ["Getting Started with p5.js"](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/mtec1101-hd88-sp2022/files/2019/03/Make_Getting-Started-with-p5dotjs.pdf) **book** by Lauren Lee McCarthy: [PDF](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/mtec1101-hd88-sp2022/files/2019/03/Make_Getting-Started-with-p5dotjs.pdf), [PDF](https://intronewmedia150.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gettingstartedp5.pdf).

## 2.3. Looking Outwards: Generative Art

![mapan.jpg](img/mapan.jpg)<br/><small>*William Mapan*</small>

### *(45 minutes; Due Tuesday 2/04)*

In this exercise, you'll look at some artworks, and make a brief post about one that caught your eye. So: below are some online collections of generative artworks. In most cases, each page presents variations produced by a single piece of software-art. *Now:*

* **Browse** these pages and **select** a project you like (or which appeals to you more than the others). 
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel `#2-3-looking-outwards`. In your post,
* **state** the project's title and artist;
* **provide** a link to the project's URL;
* **write** a sentence or two about what you found interesting about it; and
* **include** an image or screenshot of the artwork.

Note: many of these artworks are dynamic and/or interactive, and some allow you to generate new results beyond the ones already generated. For projects on the [fxhash.xyz](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) website, look for the following buttons, which (if present) will allow you to experience some projects in real-time:

## 2.4. Reading Response: Artist Narratives

![molnar's mother's letters](img/molnar_letters.jpg)<br/><small>*Vera Molnár*</small>

### *(45 minutes; Due Tuesday 2/04)*

**Skim** the following five articles, which were written by artists describing their process of developing specific generative artworks. **Select** just one of the narratives, and in the Discord channel `#2-4-narratives`, **write** a few sentences describing your observations and feelings about that artist’s process. Where possible, I recommend reading the **Web** versions as they may contain videos or interactives.

* Robert Hodgin, *Meander* (2020): [**Web**](https://roberthodgin.com/project/meander) / [PDF](pdf/hodgin_meander.pdf)
* Casey Reas, *Phototaxis* (2001-2021): [**Web**](https://medium.com/@REAS/notes-on-phototaxis-db7aa7641ad8) / [PDF](pdf/reas_phototaxis.pdf)
* Vera Molnár, *My Mother’s Letters* (1988-1995): [**PDF**](pdf/molnar-mothers-letters.pdf)

## 2.5. Graphic Primitives I: Drawing Your Initials

![gl-initials.png](img/gl-initials.png)<br/><small>*(Here are my initials, for example.)*</small>

### *(30 minutes; Due Tuesday 2/04)*

The purpose of this brief, low-stakes exercise is to familiarize yourself with the basic drawing primitives in p5.js. Some helpful techniques for **Locating Pixel Coordinates** and **Choosing Colors** are provided just below.

* Take 5 minutes to **explore** the [Reference](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/) materials for the p5.js basic graphics primitives — such as commands for: [line segment](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line), [rectangle](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect), [rounded rect](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect), [ellipse](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse), [filled arc](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/arc) (pac-man), [point](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/point) (dot), [triangle](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle), [Bézier curve](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/bezier), [spline curve](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/curve), [polyline and polygon](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginShape).
* **Start** a new project at OpenProcessing. In it, **create** a p5.js sketch with a canvas whose dimensions are no larger than 800×600 pixels. 
* **Use** the p5.js graphics primitives to **draw** your initials. You can use whichever colors and shapes you need. (You're not being asked to make your initials look like mine!)
* **Experiment** with your shapes’ options and parameters, such as fill and stroke colors, line weight, transparency, etc.
* **Add** your sketch to the appropriate assignment slot ("Graphic Primitives I") [in our OpenProcessing classroom](https://openprocessing.org/class/95759/#/c/96604). 
* **Make** a thumbnail icon for your project: in OpenProcessing, **click** on ⓘ, "Edit", and then the thumbnail square to capture an image of your project.
* In the Discord channel `#2-5-initials`, **post** a screenshot of your OpenProcessing project.
* If you get stuck anywhere, **give a shout** in the `#haaaalp` channel in our Discord!

### Help Locating Pixel Coordinates

It can sometimes be challenging to locate the pixel coordinates you want. You may find it helpful to plan your design using [graph paper](https://print-graph-paper.com/), or by displaying your cursor's coordinates using something like the following (find the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/vvEg7XbQ4)):

![mouse-recording.gif](img/mouse-recording.gif)

### Help Choosing Colors

In can also be challenging to get the values that describe the color you want. You may find it helpful to refer to this [table of common Web colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors) (which can help you refer to colors by name) as well as the [Digital Color Meter app](https://medium.com/mac-os-x/digital-color-meter-in-mac-machine-e961bedca040) that comes with MacOS. Additionally, you can easily access a color picker by [searching for one on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker):

## 2.6. Graphic Primitives II: Drawing from Life

![coding-from-life-schwulst.jpg](img/coding-from-life-schwulst.jpg)<br/><small>*[Coding from Life](https://veryinteractive.net/pages/coding-from-life.html) by Laurel Schwulst*</small>

### *(45 minutes; Due Tuesday 2/04)*

**Observe** a real location (such as your room or your desk) for 3-5 minutes. You will be using these observations to make a still life, interior, or landscape with code. You are encouraged to take ‘notes’ in the form of a drawing on paper. 

*Now:*

* **Create** a new p5.js sketch on OpenProcessing, with canvas dimensions that are no larger than 800×800 pixels.
* **Create** a drawing of your scene using p5.js code and graphics primitives.
* **Add** your sketch to the appropriate assignment ("Graphic Primitives II") [in our OpenProcessing classroom](https://openprocessing.org/class/95759/#/c/96605).
* Remember to **make** a thumbnail icon for your OpenProcessing project!
* **Create** a post in the Discord channel, `#2-6-life-drawing`.
* **Embed** a screenshot of your p5.js project in your Discord post.
* **Write** a sentence about any details you’d like to bring to our attention.

*Notes:*

1. **Note**: The world has an infinite amount of detail; you can't capture it all. *Please limit yourself to 45 minutes to execute this small project!*
2. **Note**: Advanced students, feel free to tinker by linking some properties of this composition to time, randomness, or to the mouse coordinates. That said: *this is optional* and for the time being, no instruction will be given on this. 
3. **Note**: Optionally, below is a list of some **relevant YouTube videos** that you may find helpful!!
  * [1.2 2D Primitives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hISICBkFa4Q) (Xin Xin)
  * [1.3 RGB Color & Blendmode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTEvHLLwSBE) (Xin Xin)
  * [1.3 Shapes & Drawing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3TeLi6Ns1E&t=23s) (Coding Train)
  * [1.4 Color](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riiJTF5-N7c&t=6s) (Coding Train)
  * [Basics of using OpenProcessing site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oj3DGSCMAOQ) (Dane Webster)
