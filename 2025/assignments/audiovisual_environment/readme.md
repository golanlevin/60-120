Touchdesigner is an authoring tool for high-performance interactive graphics systems. In this Looking Outwards assignment, you are asked to spend a half-hour familiarizing yourself with how people use TouchDesigner, and journaling about a project you appreciated. To do this: 

* **Identify** a project that you find interesting, by **browsing** the following sources: 
  * [The official TouchDesigner showcase on Vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/groups/touchdesigner/sort:plays/format:thumbnail). Please note that there are more than 2000 projects across 160 pages of results; please look beyond the first page!
  * [Projects tagged with Touchdesigner on CreativeApplications.net](https://www.creativeapplications.net/?s=touchdesigner). This is an important blog documenting thousands of interactive new media arts projects. To get past the paywall, use the login information in the [Discord `#key-information` channel](https://discord.com/channels/1325654518544728137/1325736563417808957/1328429634563608640). Please note that there are four pages of results there. 
* In the Discord channel `#5-2-looking-outwards`, **write** a sentence describing the project.

## 5.4. TouchDesigner Warmup

*Due Tuesday April 22; 1.5-2.5 hours. Exercise designed by Em Lugo.*

We are still learning the basics. For Tuesday, April 22, **do** the following:

* **Watch**: [Shapes and Colors](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/lessons/102-tops-working-with-images/topic/shapes-colors/) (5 minutes)
* **Watch**: [Basic Compositing](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/lessons/102-tops-working-with-images/topic/basic-compositing/) (5 minutes)
* Feel free to **watch** any of the other sections of the [100-series Working with Images lectures](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/lessons/102-tops-working-with-images/). 
 
Then: **follow along** and **execute** these two TouchDesigner tutorial projects, shown below:

* **Do**: [Organic Color Tunnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPrDMqOmJ0) (30-60 minutes)
* **Do**: [Instancing Geometry with Mouse Interactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJZIMGg-thY) (60-90 minutes)

*Now,* in a Discord post in the `#5-4-warmup` channel, please do the following:

* **Embed** a brief moving image (screen-captured video, animated GIF, or unlisted YouTube link) for each of the two project tutorials. It doesn’t have to be a lengthy video; I just need to see receipts.
* **Write** a sentence or two about your experience. What do you appreciate about TouchDesigner? What concerns or confusions do you have? Did you tinker with the project, and if so, how?

## 5.5. Audioreactive Environment

*(10-12 hours, Due Monday, May 5. Exercise designed by Em Lugo.)*

For this project, you will develop an “audio-reactive” visual composition. Your project should use audio in at least two ways to either generate or modify a graphic. It will help to:

* **Identify** some suitable audio. Given the tools you have available, instrumental rhythmic music may work best, but that’s just a suggestion, not a requirement. Edit and/or trim your audio to produce a clip that’s about 1-3 minutes long.
* **Study** project examples to understand what sorts of signals you can obtain from audio (such as amplitude from certain frequency bands).
* **Identify** a set of visual parameters you want the audio signals to control (such as the color, position, displacement, etc. of a visual design).

As you develop your project, consider whether there are visual parameters that you’d like to perform manually (e.g. with a mouse, camera, or keyboard), to change how your visuals respond to the music over time.

*Now:*

* (3 minutes) **Browse** these brief video documentations of artworks by others: **[one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AuGX_TBDnI), [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6tSht38gNs), [three](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8RfdTC8UlY), [four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhZfnWsjr8Y)**
* (15 minutes) **Watch** the two tutorials below, to give you some additional ideas about what’s possible.
* **Create** a Discord post for your project, in the channel `#5-5-audiovisual` system.
* **Develop** an audio-reactive composition, as discussed above.
* **Record** a screen-captured video of your project. (Make sure it includes the sound!) **Make sure** your video is “full-screen” and does not show the TouchDesigner program network.
* **Embed** a link to the video of your project. An ideal format would be an unlisted Youtube video. If you decide to use a Box or Google drive link, make absolutely sure that the link is set to public.
* **Write** a few sentences about your project. How would you describe the mappings you established? What do you like best about the project?
